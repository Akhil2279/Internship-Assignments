# Task 8: Build a Chatbot using if-else (Upgraded with Wikipedia API)

## Objective
Create a **rule-based chatbot** using Python and extend it with **Wikipedia integration** so that it can answer real-world questions.

---

## Tools
- Python 3.x
- `wikipedia` Python package

---

## Deliverables
- A Python script (`chatbot.py`) that simulates a chatbot with knowledge-based answers.

---

## Hints / Mini Guide
1. Use input/output loops for conversation.  
2. Use simple `if-elif-else` for predefined responses.  
3. For real questions, fetch information from **Wikipedia API**.  

---

## How it Works
- The chatbot takes user input in a loop.  
- If input matches predefined rules (like greetings, time, or name), it gives a fixed response.  
- Otherwise, it searches **Wikipedia** and returns a short summary as the answer.  
- The chat ends when the user types **"bye"**.
