# Task 7: Image Resizer Tool

## Objective
Resize and convert images in **batch** using Python.

---

## Tools
- Python 3.x  
- [Pillow (PIL)](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)  

---

##  Deliverables
A script that **resizes all images in a folder** and saves them to an output folder.

---

##  How It Works
1. Reads images from an **input folder** (`images/`).  
2. Resizes them to a fixed size (default: `300x300`).  
3. Saves the resized images into an **output folder** (`resized_images/`).  

---

## Hints / Mini Guide
- Use **os** module to read files from the folder.  
- Use **PIL.Image** to open, resize, and save images.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository or download the script.  
2. Install Pillow:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
