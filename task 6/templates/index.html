                <h3>UP Yatra</h3>
                <p>The UP Yatra project is a web-based application designed to showcase and manage information about significant cultural, historical, and spiritual destinations across Uttar Pradesh. The project allows users to explore details of different locations, view descriptions, and understand their importance. It was built using Python, Django/Flask (whichever you used) for the backend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. A structured database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) was integrated to store and manage destination details. The project highlights my ability to design user-friendly web applications, implement RESTful APIs, and manage dynamic content efficiently..</p>

                <h3>Backend API Developement</h3>
                <p>I worked on developing RESTful APIs for the KPA Form project using FastAPI and PostgreSQL, ensuring the endpoints aligned with the SwaggerHub documentation and were ready to integrate with a Flutter frontend. The implementation included a GET API for fetching Wheel Specifications and a POST API for submitting Bogie Checksheet data. The backend was structured with models (SQLAlchemy), schemas (Pydantic for validation), routes, and a main application entry point. I also upgraded the codebase to be compatible with Pydantic v2.x, resolving ForwardRef evaluation issues. The project emphasized clean architecture, proper data validation, error handling, and JSON-based responses, and I thoroughly tested the APIs using Postman to ensure reliability and accuracy.</p>
